    <p>
        I too wanted to be.
     <br>
     <br>
            
            That is all I wanted; and this is the last word.
            
<br>
<br>
       
        At the bottom of all these attempts which seemed without bounds,
        
      <br>
            
        I find the same desire again: to drive existence out of me, to rid the
        passing moments
        <br>
        of their fat, to twist them, dry them, purify myself, harden myself,
        <br>
        <br>
        <a href="10.html" class="link">to give back at last the sharp, precise sound of a saxophone note</a>. 
     <br>
     <br>
     <br>
        
       
        
    </p>
