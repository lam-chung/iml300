<body>
    <p>
        I too wanted to be.
        <div>
            
            That is all I wanted; and this is the last word.
            
        </div>
       
        At the bottom of all these attempts which seemed without bounds,
        
        <div>
            
            I find the same desire again: to drive existence out of me,
        to rid the passing moments of their fat, to twist them, dry them, purify myself, harden myself,
        <a href="10.html" class="link">to give back at last the sharp, precise sound of a saxophone note</a>. 
        </div>
        
       
        
    </p>
    
</body>
