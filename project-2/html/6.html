<body>
    <p>
        I see the <a href="7.html" class="link">future</a>.
        It is there, poised over the street, <a href="9.html" id="link">hardly more dim than the present</a>.
        What advantage will accrue from its realisation? 

    </p>

<div>
     <p>
            You don't put your past in your pocket; you have to have a <a href="5.html" class="link">house</a>.
            I have only my body: a man entirely alone, with his lonely body, cannot indulge in memories;
            they pass through him. I shouldn't complain: all I wanted was to be free.
