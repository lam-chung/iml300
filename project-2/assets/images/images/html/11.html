    <p>
        I exist. It's sweet, so sweet, so slow.
        And light: you'd think it floated all by itself.
        It stirs. It brushes by me, melts and vanishes.
        Gently, gently.
        <div>
There is bubbling water in my throat, it caresses me- and now it comes up again into my mouth.
        For ever I shall have a little pool of whitish water in my mouth - lying low - grazing my tongue.
        And this pool is still me. And the tongue. And the throat is me.
        </div>
